        <p>This is an ongoing project application that supports film photographers who are looking to improve their skills and understand their camera better by keeping track of camera settings for each frame taken. Then when the film is developed, the user can upload the corresponding photo and have a log to learn from for future rolls.
        </p>
        <p>I built all aspects of this application and it has been a fun project for something I am passionate about.
