    <p>filmy-j is built to solve a problem that personally faced as a film photographer. I was having trouble learning how to take better film photos and after each roll would come back with some really disappointing frames, I decided that it would be nice to have an application for me to be able to track the shutter speed, aperature and any other descriptor for each photo that is taken. This way I can learn from my mistakes and become a better photographer.</p>
