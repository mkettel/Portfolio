        <p>Created for Vail Health Hospital in Vail, Colorado. The site functions as
        a knowledgebase for how to setup and use the various technological equipment
        within their operating rooms. The hospital is world renown for othopedics, with many

      <p>The user can navigate through the site directly by scanning QR Codes placed in the operating rooms,
      or they can choose to navigate by category. The information is broken up into four main categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Doctors</li>
          <li>Vendors</li>
          <li>Equipment</li>

    <h2>TAKEAWAY</h2>
    <p>This was the project that sparked my interest in becoming a developer. I discovered
        how transformative it can be to utilize technology to help others do things that they
        would not typically know how to do.
