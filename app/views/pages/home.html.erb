        <p>Born and raised in the midwest, I followed my interest in science by studying physiology and chemistry in college.
          After graduating, I had a desire to see other parts of the United States, so I moved to Vail, Colorado. Here, I discovered my
          passion for technology and how it has the power to change lives. I also got to ski a lot, which was a plus. I am looking
          forward to working with ambitious teams to help bring their visions to life.
